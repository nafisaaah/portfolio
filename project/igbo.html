    	<span id="igbo"><br>Igbo, also called Ibo, people living chiefly in southeastern Nigeria who speak Igbo, a language of the Benue-Congo branch of the Niger-Congo 
        language family. The Igbo may be grouped into the following main cultural divisions: northern, southern, western, eastern or Cross River, and northeastern.Most Igbo traditionally have been subsistence farmers, their staples being yams, cassava, and taro. The other crops they grow include corn (maize), melons, 
        okra, pumpkins, and beans. Among those still engaged in agriculture, men are chiefly responsible for yam cultivation,  women for other crops. Land is owned 
        communally by kinship groups and is made available to individuals for farming and building. Some livestock, important as a source of prestige and for use in
        sacrifices, is kept. The principal exports are palm oil and palm kernels. Trading, local crafts, and wage labour also are important in the Igbo economy, 
        and a high literacy rate has helped many Igbo to become civil servants and 
        business entrepreneurs in the decades after Nigeria gained independence. It is notable that Igbo women engage in trade and are influential in local politics. </span>

    	<span id="igbo"><br><br><b>What are the Igbos known for?</b><br><br>
        The Igbos are well known for their variety of soups, made from locally grown vegetables, fruits and seeds. The most popular Igbo soups are oha, nsala, akwu,
        okazi and ofe owerri. The 
        Igbo people have a traditional religious belief that there is one creator, called 'Chineke' or 'Chukwu'.<br>
        Igbo culture includes the various customs, practices and traditions of the people. It comprises archaic practices as well as new concepts added into the
        Igbo culture either through evolution or outside influences. These customs and traditions include the Igbo people's visual art, use of language, music and
        dance forms, as well as their attire, cuisine and
        language dialects. Because of their various subgroups, the variety of their culture is heightened further. </span>

      <h3><b class="brown">Performing arts</b><br>
       The Igbo people have a musical style into which they incorporate various percussion instruments: the udu, which is essentially designed from a clay jug; 
       an ekwe, which is formed from a hollowed log; and the ogene, a hand bell designed from forged iron. Other instruments include opi, a wind instrument similar 
       to the flute, igba, and ichaka.Another popular musical form among the Igbo is highlife. A widely popular musical   genre in West Africa, highlife is a 
       fusion of jazz and traditional music. The modern Igbo highlife is seen in the works of Dr Sir Warrior, Oliver De Coque, Bright Chimezie 
       and Chief Osita Osadebe, who were among the most popular Igbo highlife musicians of the 20th century.
       </h3>
       <h3><b class="brown">visual art and architecture</b><br>
        There is such variety among Igbo groups that it is not possible to define a general Igbo art style. Bronze castings found in the town of Igbo Ukwu from the 9th century,
        constitute the earliest sculptures discovered in Igboland. Here, the grave of a well-established man of distinction and a ritual store, dating from the
        9th century AD, contained both chased copper objects and elaborate castings of leaded bronze. Along with these bronzes were 165,000 glass beads said to have originated in Egypt, Venice and India.
        Some popular Igbo art styles include Uli designs. The majority of the Igbo carve and use masks, although the function  of masks vary by community.

        Igbo art is noted for Mbari architecture. Mbari houses of the Owerri-Igbo are large opened-sided square planned shelters. 
        They house many life-sized, painted figures (sculpted in mud to appease the Alusi (deity) and Ala, the earth goddess, with other deities of thunder and water)
        .Other sculptures are of officials, craftsmen, foreigners (mainly Europeans), animals, legendary creatures and ancestors.Mbari houses take years
        to build in what is regarded as a sacred process. When new ones are constructed, old ones are left to decay. Everyday houses were made of mud with that
        ched roofs and bare earth floors with carved design doors. 
        Some houses had elaborate designs both in the interior and exterior. These designs could include Uli art designed by Igbo women.

        One of the unique structures of Igbo culture was the Nsude Pyramids, at the town of Nsude, in Abaja, northern Igboland. Ten pyramidal structures were built 
        of clay/mud.</h3>
        <h3><b class="brown">Burials</b><br>
           After a death, the body of a prominent member of society is placed on a stool in a sitting posture and is clothed in the deceased's finest garments.
           Animal sacrifices may be offered and the dead person is well perfumed.Burial usually follows within 24 hours of death. In the 21st century, 
           the head of a home is usually buried within the compound of his residence.Different types of deaths warrant different types of burials. This is 
           determined by an individual's age, gender and status in society. Children are buried in hiding and out of sight; their burials usually take place in the
           early mornings and late nights. A simple untitled man is buried in front of his house and a simple mother is buried in her place of origin: in a garden or 
           a farm-area that belonged to her father.In the 21st century,
           a majority of the Igbo bury their dead in the western way, although it is not uncommon for burials to be practiced in the traditional Igbo ways

        	<b class="brown">Marriage</b><br>
            The process of marrying usually involves asking the young woman's consent, introducing the woman to the man's family and the same for the man to the woman's family, testing the bride's character, checking the woman's family background, and paying the brides' wealth.Typically speaking, bride wealth is more symbolic. Nonetheless, kola nuts, wine, goats, and chickens, among other things, are listed in the proposal, as well. Negotiating the bride wealth can also take more than one day, giving both parties time for a ceremonial feast.
            Marriages were sometimes arranged from birth through negotiation of the two families.However, after a series of interviews conducted in the 1990s with
            250 Igbo women, it was found that 94.4% of that sample population disapproved of arranged marriages.
            A modern Igbo wedding, Nnewi, Nigeria
            In the past, many Igbo men practiced polygamy. The polygamous family is made up of a man and his wives and all their children.Men sometimes married 
            multiple wives for economic reasons so as to have more people in the family, including children, to help on farms.Christian and civil marriages have
            changed the Igbo family since colonization. Igbo people now tend to enter monogamous courtships and create nuclear families, mainly because of Western 
            influence.Some Western marriage customs, such as weddings in a church, take place either before or after the lgbo cultural traditional marriage.
        </h3>
        <h3>
        	<b class="brown">Attire</b><br>
            Traditionally, the attire of the Igbo generally consisted of little clothing, as the purpose of clothing originally was simply to conceal private parts. Because of this purpose, children were often nude from birth until the beginning of their adolescence—the time they were considered to have something to hide.

            Men wearing contemporary Isiagu with the ceremonial Igbo men's hat okpu agu
            Women traditionally carry their babies on their backs with a strip of clothing binding the two with a knot at her chest, a practice used by many ethnic groups across Africa.This method has been modernized in the form of the child carrier. Maidens usually wore a short wrapper with beads around their waist and other ornaments such as necklaces and beads.[192] Both men and women wore wrappers. Men would wear loincloths that wrapped round their waist and between their legs to be fastened at their back, the type of clothing appropriate for the intense heat as well as jobs such as farming.

            In Olaudah Equiano's narrative, Equiano describes fragrances that were used by the Igbo in the community of Essaka:

            Our principal luxury is in perfumes; one sort of these is an odoriferous wood of delicious fragrance: the other a kind of earth; a small portion of which thrown into the fire diffuses a most powerful odor. We beat this wood into powder, and mix it with palm oil; with which both men and women perfume themselves.

            As colonialism became more influential, the Igbo adapted their dress customs.[194] Clothing worn before colonialism became "traditional" and worn on 
            cultural occasions. Modern Igbo traditional attire, for men, is generally made up of the Isiagu top, which  resembles the Dashiki worn by other African groups
           .Isiagu (or ishi agu) is usually patterned with lions' heads embroidered over the clothing and can be a plain colour. It is worn with trousers and
           can be worn with either a ceremonial title holders hat or with the conventional striped men's hat known as okpu agu.
            For women, a puffed sleeve blouse along with two wrappers and a head tie are worn.

        <h3>
        	<b class="brown">Cuisine</b><br>
            Yam porridge (or yam pottage) is an Igbo dish known as awaị.
            The yam is very important to the Igbo as the staple crop. It is known for its resiliency (a yam can remain fully edible for six months without refrigeration), but it can also be very versatile in terms of its incorporation into different dishes.[198] Yams can be fried, roasted, boiled, or made into a potage with tomatoes and herbs. The cultivation of yams is most commonly carried out by men, as women tend to focus on other crops.
            There are celebrations such as the New yam festival (Igbo: Iwaji) which are held for the harvesting of the yam. During the festival,
            yam is eaten throughout the communities as celebration. Yam tubers are shown off by individuals as a sign of success and wealth.
            Rice has replaced yam for many ceremonial occasions. Other indigenous foods include cassava, garri, maize and plantains. 
            Soups or stews are included in a typical meal, prepared with a vegetable (such as okra, of which the word derives from the Igbo language, okwuru)
            to which pieces of fish, chicken, beef, or goat meat are added.
            Jollof rice is popular throughout West Africa, and palm wine is a popular alcoholic traditional beverage
